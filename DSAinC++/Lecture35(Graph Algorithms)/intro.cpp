/*
3 types of ways to to implement graph

adjacency list -> array of linked list
adjacency map -> array of maps, best to store weighted graph

adjacency matrix, a v*v sized 2d array, where v is the no of vertices

incidence matrix -> we create v*e matrix
v -> no of vertices
e-> no of edges
 better for sparse matrix
