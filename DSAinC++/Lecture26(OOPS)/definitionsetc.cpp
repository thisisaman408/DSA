/**
 just OOPs is used in large products, it is the method to write the code, opposite of procedural  programming, it is practical programing,
 object oriented programmning

 it does
 data abstraction
 data incapsulation
 inheritance
 polymorphism


 class - user_defined datatype

 class is a blueprint,

 when I write

class Student{
    int age;
    int roll_no;
    string name;
};

so here,this is just blueprint, no memmory is allocated to class

but now, when I use my user_defined_data type Student as

Student Aman;
now a student Aman has been created in memory, and his age etc all those data has a memory now

it is similar as, 
when we write int a = 10;
then write now, there is memory allocated to a,
but how is int working, the code is in the C++ library, and that library has nothing to do with the memory allocation at my computer,


we can say that, Aman here is a variable,
but in OOPs, we say Aman as object

Object is an instance of the class


there are 3 access modifiers

Private
Protected
Public
