/*
You are conducting an experiment where you attempt to cap a pen using two methods: looking at the cap and not looking at the cap. You have 
𝑛
n trials to perform the experiment. Each trial can either be done by looking at the cap or by not looking at the cap.

Given:

𝑝
look
=
0.97
p 
look
​
 =0.97: Probability of successfully capping the pen when looking at the cap.
𝑝
no_look
=
0.005
p 
no_look
​
 =0.005: Probability of successfully capping the pen when not looking at the cap.
𝑛
n: Total number of trials.
You can choose to either look or not look at the cap for each trial to maximize the expected number of successful cappings.

Objective:
Maximize the expected number of successful cappings over 
𝑛
n trials.

Constraints:
1
≤
𝑛
≤
1000
1≤n≤1000
Problem:
Formulate a dynamic programming solution to determine the maximum expected number of successful cappings over 
𝑛
n trials.
