/*

The constructor is always with the class, it is a hidden function, which basically initialises the class,
and it do object creation,
when we create an object, the compiler goes to constructor and then constructer gives us the object,


very similar to a function

the return type of constructor will be same as the datatype/returntype of class

there is no name of constructor,
for example if I create a class named bike

class Bike{

};
so the constructor will be like
Bike (){
    // there is no name, just data type
}

Types of Constructor

Default Constructor


Parameterized constructor




Copy Constructor





Destructor

very similar to constructor
it gets called, when object goes out of scope
the scope of any variable or datatype or even an object is within the {} of any function class, or any if-else condition
 there are no parameteres in destructor
 ~Bike(){

 }
 we will call destructor in this way!
